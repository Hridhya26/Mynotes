# Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
- Converts data from d-dimentional space to a lower dimentional space.
- Helps in faster training and inference of models.
- Data visualization becomes easier with lower dimentional representation of data.

  PCA finds a new set of dimensions such that all the dimensions are orthogonal(and hence linearly independent) and ranked according to the varince of the data along them.

  Find a transformation such that
