# Statistics- the science which helps in making decisions.
              Statistics helps in finding whether causation exists or not.
- Statistics branches into two - Descriptive and inferential statistics.
  
- Measures of central tendency - Mean,Median,Mode

- Percentile.
  
- Marks - low to high again to low - distribution curve or bell curve or Normally distributed.

- Mean fails when data isn't symmetric or when it has extreme values.

## Dispersion - Scattering of data.
- Measures of dispersion - Range,Standard deviation,Variance.
  
- Variance is the square of standard deviation.

- Outlier - A data point that differs significantly from other observations.

- Inter Quartile Range(IQR) - Q3-Q1.

- Q1 - 25th percentile .

- Q2 - 50th percentile(Median).

- Q3 - 75th percentile. 

- Lower Bound - Q1-1.5*IQR. 

- Upper Bound - Q3+1.5*IQR.

- The point above and below these bounds is called an outlier.

- All these can be found using a box plot.

- Line plot and box plot are univariate.

- Scatter plot - to inspect relation

- Correlation coefficient- (a)Pearson Correlation
                         (b)Spearman Correlation
                         
                         - Both lies between -1 and 1.
- Pearson used for linear relationships between continuous variables.

- Spearman used for monotonic relationships based on ranks rather than  values.

- Cumulative Density Function.

- Probability Density Function.

- Z score - Z = (Point-Mean)/Standard Deviation .

- Confidence Interval - Assuming normally distributed , if not , cannot be defined.

- Inferential Statistics is the branch which helps in making decisions.
