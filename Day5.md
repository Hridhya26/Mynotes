## Probability 
Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur.

## Normal Distribution
Is a special case of Gaussian curve,where mean=0 and standard deviation=1.

## Sampling 
Involves selecting a part of the population to obtain necessary data for analysis.

- Population - In statistics, the entire data is known as population. Eg: Income of the entire population of India(150 Cr).
             - In this case the sample we take is 15 Cr.
             - Commonly the income curve is Bimodal Distribution.
  
- Sampling Distribution - Sampling distribution is also known as a finite-sample distribution. Sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic based on random samples of a given population. It represents the distribution of frequencies on how spread apart various outcomes will be for a specific population.

- Central Limit Theorem -   The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's distribution

- Significance Level - If a result is statistically significant, that means it’s unlikely to be explained solely by chance or random factors. In other words, a statistically significant result has a very low chance of occurring if there were no true effect in a research study.

The p value, or probability value, tells you the statistical significance of a finding. In most studies, a p value of 0.05 or less is considered statistically significant, but this threshold can also be set higher or lower.

# p value 
The p value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true.

P values are used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p value, the more likely you are to reject the null hypothesis.

- Null Hypothesis -  (H0): There’s no effect in the population.

- Alternate Hypothesis -  (Ha or H1): There’s an effect in the population.

- z test -  A Z-test is any statistical test for which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution. Z-test tests the mean of a distribution.

- t test -  A t-test is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related. T-tests are used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances, like the data set recorded from flipping a coin 100 times.
