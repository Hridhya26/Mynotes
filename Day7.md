- Matrix - a rectangular array of numbers.

- Eigen vectors
  - Vectors that remain in the same direction after a linear transformation.
  - Do not change direction under transformation.

- Eigen values
  - Scalars associated with eigen vectors.
  - Represent the factor by which the eigen vector is scaled during the transformation.

- Projection of a matrix

- Norm of a vector is magnitude.

- UV Decomposition
  - UV Decomposition,more commonly known as Singular Value Decomposition(SVD).
  - Matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices.
  - A powerful tool in linear algebra with numerous applications in data science and machine learning.
