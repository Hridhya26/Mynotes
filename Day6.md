## Different types of distributions are

- Uniform Probability Distribution - Uniform Distribution is the probability distribution that represents equal likelihood of all outcomes within a specific range. i.e. the probability of each outcome occurring is the same. Whether dealing with a simple roll of a fair die or selecting a random number from a continuous interval, uniform distribution provides a straightforward yet powerful model for understanding randomness.Eg:Dice

- Gaussian Probability Distribution -  A Gaussian distribution, also referred to as a normal distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical about its mean; most observations cluster around the mean, and the further away an observation is from the mean, the lower its probability of occurring.Eg:Marks

- Log Normal Distribution - a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.Eg:Customer Time Online

- Bernoulli Distribution - Bernoulli Distribution is a type of discrete probability distribution where every experiment conducted asks a question that can be answered only in yes or no. In other words, the random variable can be 1 with a probability p or it can be 0 with a probability (1 - p). Such an experiment is called a Bernoulli trial. A pass or fail exam can be modeled by a Bernoulli Distribution.

## Skewness 
Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. A distribution is asymmetrical when its left and right side are not mirror images.

  - We say that a distribution of data values is left skewed if it has a “tail” on the left side of the distribution:

  - We say that a distribution is right skewed if it has a “tail” on the right side of the distribution:

  - And we say a distribution has no skew if it’s symmetrical on both sides:

## Kurtosis
Kurtosis is a measure of the tailedness of a distribution. Tailedness is how often outliers occur.

- Distributions with medium kurtosis (medium tails) are mesokurtic.
- Distributions with low kurtosis (thin tails) are platykurtic.
- Distributions with high kurtosis (fat tails) are leptokurtic.
